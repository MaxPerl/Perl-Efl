# Perl-Efl

Perl bindings for the Enlightenment Foundation Libraries (EFL). The module gives a nice object-oriented interface. Apart from that the API is deliberatly kept close to the Elementary API. The perl method names generally remove the prefix at the beginning of the c functions. Therefore applying the C documentation should be no problem. 

For the documentation in detail please study the single modules and the documentation at https://www.enlightenment.org/docs/start
